   <p style="font-size: 20px;">  I thought about you again today. It's still strange how you've come to me just once- A very sad "once" <br> I haven't forgiven you yet- for dying, even though I know you fought. A part of me thinks we'd have won if we fought harder.
I want you to say "Rapu onye ala a" and smile sweetly when I make some of my silly jokes or be sarcastic. <br>
I want to see you again, I want to yell at you when I'm upset, grumble when you send me on errands, laugh alike and so loudly with you in a way that some people would say "Kamsy yichasialu Nneka, oyifokwia"
I feel bad that I don't grieve enough, I feel like I should sit and cry everyday and never move on but alas, I don't. <br> Does this mean I didn't love you enough?
